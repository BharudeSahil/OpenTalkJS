Here's a poem about nature:

The forest whispers secrets low,
Of ancient trees that stand and grow.
Their leaves, a rustling gentle hue,
A soothing melody, for me and you.

The sun shines bright, upon the sea,
A reflection of its beauty, wild and free.
The waves crash strong, against the shore,
A symphony, that I adore.

In nature's arms, I find my peace,
A sense of calm, that never will cease.
The wind it whispers, through the trees so tall,
A lullaby, that echoes through it all.

The stars appear, in the evening sky,
A twinkling canvas, that catches the eye.
The world is hushed, in a quiet sleep,
As nature's beauty, my soul does keep.

In this poem, I've tried to capture the serenity and wonder of nature. The forest is depicted as a place of ancient wisdom, while the sun and sea are shown as powerful and beautiful forces. The wind whispers through the trees, creating a soothing melody, and the stars shine brightly in the evening sky. The overall tone is one of peace and tranquility, inviting the reader to connect with the natural world.
