In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
A gentle breeze stirs, rustling leaves above,
As earthy scents and petals fill the air with love.

The sun's warm touch ignites the morning dew,
And dew-kissed flowers unfold their petals anew.
The song of birds, a chorus so divine,
Echoes through the trees, a symphony so fine.

In moonlit night, the stars appear to shine,
A celestial canvas, infinite and divine.
The world is bathed in silver light and shade,
As nature's beauty takes its sacred stage.

The river's voice, a gentle lapping sound,
Echoes through the valleys, where the wild things abound.
The wind whispers tales of ancient lands and seas,
As earthy rhythms weave their mystic melodies.

In every breath, I find my peaceful nest,
Where nature's harmony finds its eternal rest.
A refuge from the world's loud, chaotic din,
Nature's symphony, a love that will forever win.
