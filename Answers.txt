In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand watch, their leaves a rustling gold.

The wind, a gentle lover's sigh,
Stirs scents of blooms and earthy high.
The sun, a burning ember's glow,
Casts shadows deep, where creatures grow.

In forests dark, where ancient secrets sleep,
The creatures roam, their footsteps soft and deep.
The trees, like guardians of the past,
Guard mysteries that will forever last.

The rivers flow, a winding stream,
Where ripples dance, and waters gleam.
Their voices echo through the land,
A soothing melody, so calm and grand.

In nature's heart, where life begins,
The cycles turn, the seasons spin.
From birth to growth, from bloom to decay,
Life pulses on, in endless play.

Oh, let us cherish this world we share,
And honor all that's living there.
For in its depths, we find our own,
A reflection of the beauty shown.
